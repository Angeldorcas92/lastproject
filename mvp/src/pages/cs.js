      <h2 className="cs-title">CS (Cesarean Section) Delivery:</h2>
      <p className="cs-description">
        CS, also known as a C-section, is a surgical procedure in which a baby is delivered through an incision in the mother's abdomen and uterus. It is typically performed when vaginal delivery poses risks to the mother or baby's health or when certain complications arise during pregnancy or labor.
      </p>

      <h3 className="cs-subtitle">Importance of Consenting to CS Delivery:</h3>
      <ul className="cs-explanation">
        <li>
          <strong>Medical Necessity:</strong> CS delivery may be necessary to safeguard the health and well-being of the mother and baby. It can prevent complications such as fetal distress, placenta previa, prolonged labor, or issues with the baby's positioning.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Emergency Situations:</strong> In some cases, a CS delivery is performed as an emergency procedure when unforeseen complications or emergencies arise during labor, putting the mother or baby at risk. It allows for a prompt and safe delivery.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Planned CS:</strong> In certain situations, a planned CS delivery may be recommended by healthcare providers based on pre-existing conditions or factors that increase the risk of complications during vaginal delivery. This includes cases of breech presentation, multiple pregnancies, certain maternal medical conditions, or a history of previous CS deliveries.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Maternal Choice:</strong> Some women may choose CS delivery for personal or medical reasons. This decision should be made after thorough discussions with healthcare providers, considering factors such as previous birth experiences, medical history, and individual circumstances.
