        <p>
          Episiotomy is a surgical incision made in the perineum (the area
          between the vagina and anus) during childbirth. It is performed by a
          healthcare provider to enlarge the vaginal opening and facilitate
          delivery, especially in cases where the birth canal needs additional
          space or to expedite the delivery process.
